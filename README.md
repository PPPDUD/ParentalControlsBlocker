# ParentalControlsBlocker
A free and obfuscated batch file designed to keep Microsoft Family Safety at bay.

# Operation instructions
To begin using this program, download ParentalContorlsBlocker.bat and run it as an admin. It should appear idle and say "Time to end parental controls once and for all!" at the top of the screen if it functions properly. Remember to put in Administrator mode (run it as admin) or else it will silently fail to stop Family Safety.

# How it works
ParentalControlsBlocker works by repeatedly ending the process "WpcMon.exe" silently even if it's already closed. The exact specs will not be shared for the sake of secrecy from nosy parents.

# IMPORTANT WARNINGS AND DISCLAIMERS

Please remember that as soon as this program ends operation, it is expected that Family Safety and all of its tools will quickly restart and catch up on any extra time.
NEVER restart or give the computer to your parents while bypassing screentime limits. They could find out about this program and/or restart your computer to cause your device to become locked. There is nothing we can do about this.

WE ARE NOT REPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR PUNISHMENTS ARISING FROM THE USAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS. YOU AGREE THAT IT IS YOUR FAULT IF YOUR DEVICE EXPERIENCES ANY ISSUES AFTER ATTEMPTING TO OPERATE THIS PRODUCT. I DID A REALLY GOOD JOB MAKING THAT SOUND LIKE A REAL, LEGAL DISCLAIMER.
